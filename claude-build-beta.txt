# Task: Convert AP Statistics Unit 4 website to Unit 5

## Essential files to modify:
- **index.html**: Main website to update from Unit 4 to Unit 5

## Core changes (in order of importance):
1. Change all Unit 4 references to Unit 5 throughout index.html
2. Update exam weight from 10-20% to 7-12% for Unit 5
3. Update PDF paths from `pdfs/unit4/4.X_quiz.pdf` to `pdfs/unit5/5.X_quiz.pdf`
4. Replace video links using URLs from urls-map.md
5. Update the capstone section with Unit 5's progress check components

## Implementation guidance:
Focus on these specific pattern changes:

```
"Unit 4" → "Unit 5"
"Probability, Random Variables, and Probability Distributions" → "Sampling Distributions"
"10-20%" → "7-12%"
"pdfs/unit4/4." → "pdfs/unit5/5."
"id: "4-" → "id: "5-"
"name: "Topic 4." → "name: "Topic 5."
"unit4_pc" → "unit5_pc"
```

In the JavaScript pdfFiles array, update each topic object following this example:
```javascript
// FROM:
{
    id: "4-1",
    name: "Topic 4.1",
    description: "Introducing Statistics: Random and Non-Random Patterns?",
    videos: [
        {
            url: "https://apclassroom.collegeboard.org/d/7vn9faj6p9?sui=33,4",
            // ...
        }
    ],
    // ...
}

// TO:
{
    id: "5-1",
    name: "Topic 5.1",
    description: "Introducing Statistics: Why Is My Sample Not Like Yours?",
    videos: [
        {
            url: "https://apclassroom.collegeboard.org/d/[new-url]?sui=33,5",
            // ...
        }
    ],
    // ...
}
```

## Important notes:
- Replace all video URLs with ones from urls-map.md for Unit 5
- Make sure to update ID values everywhere (HTML IDs and JavaScript references)
- All PDF paths must use the new pattern
- Update both content text and variable names/identifiers
