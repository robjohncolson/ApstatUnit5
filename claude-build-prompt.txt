Please help me adapt my educational web materials from one unit to another in my AP course. Specifically:

1. I have an index.html file currently designed for Unit X that needs to be converted to Unit Y
2. I've provided several reference files:
   - Index-reference-spec.json (design spec documentation)
   - urls-map.md (listing all video URLs for the target unit)
   - pdf-map.txt (mapping original PDF filenames to their recommended names)
   - A directory listing showing all available files

For this adaptation:
- Update all titles, headings, and references from Unit X to Unit Y
- Replace the pdfFiles array with entries for all topics in Unit Y
- Ensure proper PDF paths point to the correct directory structure
- Include all topics with their videos, even if some lack PDF materials
- Preserve the general structure and functionality of the original
- Update any unit-specific text throughout the file

Please work methodically, explaining key changes and checking for any missed references to the original unit.
